That’ll be visible right above this text. This is the very first post on my site. As I build, I’m wavering between wanting to make a portofolio, a blog, or a diary. This post lends no clarity on that question.</p>

<p>Oh well! Clarity will come later. For now, my goal is just to get a good handle on Jekyll. If there was a comment section here, I’d invite input. As is… email me? I’ve edited config.yml so my new email address should show up below this post. Maybe I should connect a twitter account too…</p>

<p>Next steps for me and this site: learn more markdown (how do I make a bulleted list?), stop typing post content directly into vscode, install a theme or otherwise customise UX, and of course, go live instead of doing all of this locally.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The date is April 22nd.
