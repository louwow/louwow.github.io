The date is April 22nd. That'll be visible right above this text. This is the very first post on my site. As I build, I'm wavering between wanting to make a portofolio, a blog, or a diary. This post lends no clarity on that question. 

Oh well! Clarity will come later. For now, my goal is just to get a good handle on Jekyll. If there was a comment section here, I'd invite input. As is... email me? I've edited config.yml so my new email address should show up below this post. 

Next steps for me and this site: learn more markdown (how do I make a bulleted list?), stop typing post content directly into vscode, install a theme or otherwise customise UX, and of course, go live instead of doing all of this locally.
